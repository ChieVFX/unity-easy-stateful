## Quickstart

EasyStateful can be installed via package manager. Window -> Package Manager -> + -> Add package from Git url: https://github.com/ChieVFX/unity-easy-stateful.git?path=Packages/com.chievfx.easy-stateful

Pulling other branches/commits can be done by appending branch name, eg https://github.com/ChieVFX/unity-easy-stateful.git?path=Packages/com.chievfx.easy-stateful#r/v0_0_2

Dependencies are resolved automatically by the Package Manager — Easy Stateful uses [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) for its async transitions and ships its own tween/easing engine, so there's nothing else to install.

---

## 📦 Samples

Import from **Window → Package Manager → Easy Stateful → Samples**, then open a scene and press **Play**.

* **Basic Example** — the minimal setup: a `StatefulRoot` with a few states and runtime `TweenToState` transitions.
* **Showcase** — a small multi-page demo app built entirely from `StatefulRoot` widgets: a segmented control with a morphing hero, animated toggle / checkbox / star-rating / stepper, an accordion, a slide-in drawer, toast, modal, a FAB speed-dial, a side-by-side **easing comparison** lab, custom uGUI shaders (animated gradient + shimmer), a skeleton→content loader, and a **hologram materialize** effect — the last one driven by tweening a *custom script value*, showing the engine isn't limited to built-in component properties.
* **Performance Lab** — spawns an adjustable swarm of `StatefulRoot` objects and fires simultaneous transitions while reporting live FPS / frame-time, so you can see how the tween engine scales.


# Easy Stateful for Unity

*Effortless state management and animated transitions for Unity GameObjects(especially UI).*

## ✨ Overview

**Easy Stateful for Unity** enables a quick and visual workflow for creating and managing object states via Unity's built-in Animation system. It lets you define visual/object states in editor mode, preview them instantly, and trigger smooth state transitions at runtime with customizable time and easing.

---

## 🔧 Setup & Workflow

### 1. Add the Component

Attach the `StatefulRoot` script to any prefab or GameObject you'd like to animate statefully.

### 2. Enter Work Mode

Click **"Work Mode"** in the inspector. First time per object you’ll be prompted to save a Unity **Animation Clip** —this serves as the backbone for your state definitions (editor-only).

### 3. Record States

Then:

* Unity's **Animation Window** opens automatically.
* It enters **Record Mode** to track your changes and "lock" is applied to it.
* If just created, a default state `"Default"` is created as well.

### 4. Add New States

Click **"New State"** in the `StatefulRoot` component to add more states.

> **Each state is linked to a frame in the animation.**
>
> It is recognized by an **AnimationEvent** on that frame, using the state’s name.

### 5. Save Runtime Data

When you're done setting up keyframes:

* Click **"Runtime Mode"**
* First time, it prompts you to save the generated **ScriptableObject** —this contains runtime data for all your states.

---

## ▶️ Previewing States

Inside `StatefulRoot`, use the **state preview buttons** to switch between states in the editor—no need to enter Play Mode.

## 🧠 Using From Code

Trigger transitions at runtime via:

* `duration` and `ease` are optional, as it takes them from global settings/group settings or instance settings, where it can be set by ui designers.

---

## 🌟 Additional Features

### 1. Hierarchical Transition Settings

You can define easing and duration for transitions at three levels:

* **Global** (default for all transitions)
* **Group-level overrides** using `StatefulGroupSettingsData` (a ScriptableObject)
* **Per-instance overrides**
* **Per-call** via `TweenToState` method

### 2. Property-Based Rules

Use property overrides to customize how certain properties transition:

Example use-cases(that are created by default in Global Settings):

* `GameObject.enabled`:
  * **Enabling** : set `enabled = true` at first frame
  * **Disabling** : set `enabled = false` at the last frame
* `Color` transitions:
  * Default to **linear easing** to prevent flickering

Define these rules globally or in group-level settings.

### 3. Debug Scrubbing (`debugPause`)

Every `StatefulRoot` exposes a `debugPause` field (also a slider in the inspector):

* **Negative** (default `-1`) → normal playback.
* **`0`–`1`** → freezes any active transition at that normalized progress.

Fire a transition with `TweenToState(...)`, then scrub `debugPause` to hold it mid-way — e.g. `0.25` to inspect it a quarter of the way through, or `0.5` for the halfway pose. Set it back below `0` to resume. Handy for fine-tuning a look, design review, and deterministic QA screenshots.

---

## 🎹 Work Mode Hotkeys

* `Alt + 4`: Selects the object currently being worked on
* `Alt + 5`: Fills in missing keyframes by copying from `"Default"` state

  *(Prevents unintended interpolation between keyframes)*

---

## ✅ Summary

With **Easy Stateful for Unity** , you can:

* Build complex stateful object behaviors fast and efficiently
* Preview transitions in-editor
* Trigger smooth transitions with customizable logic at runtime

Perfect for UI, VFX, environment toggles, or anything that needs multiple visual states!
