## Quickstart

EasyStateful can be installed via package manager. Window -> Package Manager -> + -> Add package from Git url: https://github.com/ChieVFX/unity-easy-stateful.git?path=Assets/Project

Pulling other branches/commits can be done by appending branch name, eg https://github.com/ChieVFX/unity-easy-stateful.git?path=Assets/Project#r/v0_01a

You should also install DoTween(free version), as for now this package depends on it for tweening.
